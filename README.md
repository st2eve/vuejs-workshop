# Workshop : Vuejs Initiation

Hello to you young coder,

This workshop is offered to you in order to learn as simply and efficiently as possible how to use the Vuejs framework.

It has been very very very inspired by the [Vue Mastery course](https://youtu.be/bzlFvd0b65c) from which it takes a lot of elements but with some modifications/additions.
